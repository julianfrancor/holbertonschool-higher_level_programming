    characters describing the way in which the file will be used.

    writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased),
    and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the
    file is automatically added to the end. 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing.
    The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.
